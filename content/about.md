## About Me
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/profile_pic.JPEG" alt="avatar">}}

Thanks for checking out this page.  A little about me -  I finished my BS in Mathematics at Northeastern University in May 2022, and will be completing an MS in Applied Mathematics by May 2023.  Along the way, I completed two six month co-ops, one at Homesite Insurance as an Actuarial Analyst and the second at John Hancock Insurance in Distribution Analytics.  My dream job is being a math professor at a small college in the middle of nowhere that emphasizes undergraduate research.  While I don't know if that's where I'll end up, I'll do everything I can to head in that direction, which includes applying to PhD programs in fall 2022.


## Projects
<ul>
<li>
In Spring 2020, I completed a capstone course (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4025">MATH 4025</a>) where I worked with two other students to explore traffic impacts by the proposed MBTA GLX Green Line extension into Medford, MA.  We developed a metric we called <i>traffic score</i>, which represented the traffic congestion in a given road intersection at a given time.  To do this, we used the MBTA Developer API to capture GPS locations of commuter buses every second over the span of three weeks.  Once we obtained the relevant data, a variety of statistical tests were run.  Our paper is available upon request.
</li>
<li>
In Summer 2021, I participated in the Northeastern <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rtg-northeastern/undergraduate/independent-research-experience?authuser=0">Summer Math Research Program</a>, learning about geometric configurations.  I co-wrote an expository <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13565">paper</a> that examines relations to symmetry groups and some interesting patterns. It also highlights a script I wrote to help better visualize various historical generation algorithms.  
</li>
<li>
In Spring 2022, I completed yet another capstone course (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=202310&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4020">MATH 4020</a>) where I explored minimal surfaces, focusing on area minimization.  This was an independent project, advised by Professor Xuwen Zhu, and concluded with a final <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPpttYQueK7-yuwLujigMNhiOTQj2f2G/view?usp=sharing">paper</a> and presentation open to students and faculty.  I will be continuing this project with an independent study course in the fall.

## Math Department Involvement
<ul>
<li>
I was the 2021-22 Northeastern <a href = "https://neu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/math-club">Math Club </a> president, overseeing the transition of the club back to in-person gatherings and the push to increase accessibility for and attendance of underclassmen students.  With the help of my executive board, we hosted a variety of speakers and panels, and trips to events at Brown University and the Museum of Science.  Meetings averaged 20-30 attendees per talk, with some attracting upwards of 50, which was an increase of over 25% from years past.  With the help of the addition of two officers, we increased our social media involvement, engaging incoming freshmen and current students on Twitter and Instagram, and grew our Discord server to over 300 members.  We also greatly improved our collaboration efforts with other Math Department organizations, including the Diversity & Inclusion Committee, MathEMA, and the Association of Women in Mathematics.  <br><br>

Following a successful campaign to bring much needed improvements to the club constitution, I stepped down as president after my undergraduate careeer came to a close.  However, I continue to be an advocate for the Math Club, and will be a de facto student advisor for the new officers for the 2022-23 academic year.  For work done with the Math Club, I received the Alberto Galmarino Award in May 2022, an award given to up to one undergraduate math student each year in recognition of service to the department. </li>
<li>
I am a member of the department's Diversity & Inclusion Committee, where I was originally representing the Math Club but now the master's program.  This committee consists of faculty and students and meets regularly throughout the year (including summers) to discuss, among other topics, how to increase student engagement with department events and organizations, as well as how to better communicate with students as a whole.
</li>
<li>
During my time as an undergraduate student, I also was a peer tutor, a teaching assistant for an introduction to proofs course for math and CS majors (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=1365">MATH 1365</a>), and a grader for courses such as Calculus 3 (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=2321">MATH 2321</a>), Linear Algebra (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=2331">MATH 2331</a>), and Complex Variables (<a href="https://wl11gp.neu.edu/udcprod8/bwckctlg.p_disp_course_detail?cat_term_in=201330&subj_code_in=MATH&crse_numb_in=4555">MATH 4555</a>).
</li>
</ul>



## Community Involvement
<ul>
<li>
I have been an academic volunteer at <a href="https://squashbusters.org/">SquashBusters</a> since 2017, assisting middle and high school students with homework and projects.  I also help as needed helping prepare juniors and seniors for the SATs and for college applications.
</li>
<li>
I was a mentor for <a href="https://sites.google.com/nhsau57.org/salemrobotics">FRC 6324</a>, a high school robotics team from Salem, NH, until early 2020.  A proud alumnus, I took the skills I developed as the 2016-17 season student coach to mentor the electrical sub-teams and assist with strategy development.
</li>
</ul>

## Other fun facts
<ul>
<li>
I play the tenor saxophone, and have since junior high school.  In high school, I did marching band, jazz ensemble & concert band.  In college, I played in the Northeastern Pep Band (all five years) & Concert Band (until 2019).
</li>
<li>
I played chess competitively until I realized I didn't have patience for many-hour games (around the end of junior high).  I switched to teaching chess, and started an after-school chess program for elementary school students while I was in high school.  By the time I graduated, I had taught over 400 students, having run programs at five local schools and coordinated several other volunteers.  I still play recreationally, and am always willing to start a game.
</li>
<li>
I have two dogs, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5iYEeQWCXcFZc6ns9">Merwin</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fZBftfccdg7yFLMK8">Quincy</a>, and a bunch of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/idMGZAWE86AF3bXL7">chickens</a>.
