### About
 
Thanks for checking out this page.  A little about me - I am currently an MS student at Northeastern University studying applied mathematics, having graduated with a BS in Mathematics in May 2022.  Since graduating from Salem High School in Salem NH in 2017, I have been involved with a variety of programs that have allowed me to be tutor and mentor for many high school and college students. This includes academic mentoring of middle and high school students in several Boston area programs, supporting college students as a tutor for the Northeastern Math Department, and being a private tutor for students in grades 7 through 12.  I have also been a teaching assistant for several undergraduate math courses, and a substitute teacher for Salem School District.  Having tutored throughout the pandemic, I am able to work with students to help them develop skills to deal wih a post-pandemic education, in addition to providing support in mathematics.

### Courses
I offer tutoring in grades 7-12.  Names depend on the school, but this usually includes -
||    
---|---|---
Pre-Algebra | Algebra 1 | Geometry
Algebra 2 | Pre-Calculus/Trigonometry | Calculus 
AP Calculus AB | AP Calculus BC | AP Statistics 

If you're looking for a course that isn't listed here, still [reach out](mailto:nipaynetutoring@gmail.com)!  This definitely isn't an exhaustive list.

*I am also willing to work with college students, so if you're an undergraduate looking for assistance with courses in calculus, differential equations, or linear algebra, please reach out.*

### Session Info & Pricing

**Rate:** $40/hour (regardless of whether the session is in-person or online)

**Session Length:** 30, 60, or 90 minutes, whatever works best.
<br>


While I primarily offer sessions online, I do offer both.

<br>
<font size="+1">**Online:**</font>

While there are a variety of platforms, I have found that these work best.
<ul>
<li>
Voice and video chat using <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. <i>If internet speed is an issue, voice chat can be done over the the phone.</i>
</li>
<li>
Shared online whiteboard using <a href="https://webwhiteboard.com/">Miro</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Please note, you do not need to make an account for either of these - personalized links will be sent prior to each session.

**Payment:** I accept either Paypal or Venmo, and payment can be made at the conclusion of each session.

### Cancellation/No Show policy
Things happen - we're all human, after all.  If you need to cancel for any reason, please just let me know.  Cancellation fees will be assessed as follow

Time            | Fee      
----------------|----------
More than 24 hours prior | No charge
Between 1 hour and 24 hours prior | 1st time - no charge.  Otherwise - 1/2 of agreed upon session price
Less than 1 hour prior (includes no shows) | 1st time - 1/2 of agreed upon session price.  Otherwise - full session price

Unless we've communicated ahead of time, in the event that you are late, the session will end at the previously agreed upon time and you will be charged the full session price.  If you are more than 15 minutes late, this will count as a no show.

Two no shows will result in the inability to schedule future sessions.


### Flexibility
Everything above are relatively flexible - please [reach out](mailto:nipaynetutoring@gmail.com) if you have questions!
